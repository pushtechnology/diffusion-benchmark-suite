				state for a period of time after the connection is closed (typically known 
				as the TIME_WAIT state or 2MSL wait state). For applications using a well 
				known socket address or port it may not be possible to bind a socket to the 
				required SocketAddress if there is a connection in the timeout state involving 
				the socket address or port. This feature allows the socket to be bound even

			<!-- Performance preferences are described by three integers whose values 
				indicate the relative importance of short connection time, low latency, and 
				high bandwidth. The absolute values of the integers are irrelevant; in order 
				to choose a protocol the values are simply compared, with larger values indicating 
				stronger preferences. Negative values represent a lower priority than positive 
				values. If the application prefers short connection time over both low latency 
				and high bandwidth, for example, then it could invoke this method with the 
				values (1, 0, 0). If the application prefers high bandwidth above low latency, 
				and low latency above short connection time, then it could invoke this method 
				with the values (0, 1, 2) -->
